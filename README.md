1.  Better smartphones, a cure for cancer and the fight against hunger
    in Africa if slavery persisted?

Benefits of slavery for world development: (224)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.1<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Improving Life in Africa:

The slave trade encouraged international trade between Africa, the US
and Europe. Numerous goods were traded with Africa in exchange for
slaves. These products were subsequently used in Africa to improve the
well-being of its people. In addition, the slave market attracted
increasing numbers of European visitors who traded goods with Americans
and Africans.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.2<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Multiculturalism:

When different countries interacted, they exchanged their culture. This
contributed to the building of long-term relationships and the
development of nations. In addition, the slave trade also led to
intermarriage. People from different continents intermarried to produce
mixed races.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.3<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>free trade:

Slavery contributed to free trade by providing free labor to European
farms, increasing profitability and economic growth.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.4<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Fast production:

Slavery enabled rapid production in industry with efficient slave
contributions to the manufacturing process.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.5<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Economic stability:

Slavery served as a stabilizing force for the British economy during the
colonial period as it took advantage of the economic benefits of
enslaved labour.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.6<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>transport system:

The slave trade fueled the rapid development of the transportation
industry across the Atlantic and led to innovations in shipbuilding.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.7<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Job security:

The master had to feed the slaves even if they got sick or got old. This
was the main reason why some people went into slavery voluntarily. When
work was not available, the master had to feed his slaves for future
jobs.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.8<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Exploration:

The slave trade was one of the factors that contributed to exploration
in Africa, Europe and the Americas. Merchants explored new places each
time they visited a different market.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">1.9<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Development:

Slaveholders saved money by not hiring employees, leading to increased
profits and potential local development.

1.  Can roadblocks and polarization effectively solve the environmental
    crisis?
    1.  <span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:ignore">  
        </span>Is the blocking of<span class="Strong"> </span>Streets to
        be seen on Instagram and YouTube or to gain political power for
        one's group, an effective approach? Or would such measures
        polarize society in such a way that even possible effective
        solutions would no longer be heard? (223)
    2.  <span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:ignore">  
        </span>Are e-cars environmentally friendly?

E-cars need ten times more chips than petrol or diesel vehicles. The
Chips Act, passed by Joe Biden, limits US technology involvement in
semiconductor production. As technology manufacturers prioritize profit,
poorer countries depend on importing technology, perpetuating a cycle of
wealth inequality that benefits the rich and leaves the poor behind.
This contributes to growing inequality (139, 140).

1.  Hashtag #woke #awareness #equality #stopasianhate, credible?

Luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci support social justice
movements on social media (#equality, #blacklivesmatter), but also sell
luxury goods to signal status. (218, 219, 222).

1.  <span class="Strong" style="font-weight:bold; color:#0d0d0d">Is the
    freedom of drug dealers justifiable?</span>

In most societies, drug dealers are outlawed by law, as drug abuse can
lead to addiction, mental health problems, violence, and the breakdown
of society. This has high social health, economic and family costs.
However, drug users should not be treated as criminals as they are
suffering under circumstances beyond their control. However, it is known
that drug dealers nonetheless make significant sums of money, amounting
to hundreds of thousands of euros per year. (8,169,170,171).

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">4.1<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Is it moral to make money through drug trafficking for
charity?

Pablo Escobar, a Colombian drug lord and leader of the Medellín cartel,
which controlled up to 80% of international cocaine, supported the
community by building schools, sports fields, donating significant sums
of money to charity, and constructing homes (187).

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">4.2<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Is it legitimate that some drug dealers claim that
addiction is self-inflicted because the right medication and dosage can
cure certain diseases?

Opium has legitimate medicinal uses. (208)

1.  Social media not completely harmful, users' own fault, convincing
    argument?
    1.  <span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:ignore">  
        </span><span class="ListenabsatzZchn">Is it acceptable for
        influencers and pornography creators to claim that individuals
        are responsible for their addiction and should be aware of what
        they consume, despite the documented impact of social media such
        as mental health issues, cyberbullying, misinformation, negative
        behavior, impaired social interactions, decreased productivity,
        polarization, impact on self-image and exposure to inappropriate
        content, and privacy concerns? (207)</span>
    2.  <span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:ignore">  
        </span>Is it fair that a social media star earns up to 300 times
        more than a nursing assistant who earns around 1500 euros a
        month? (1,4,5)

Activities on platforms like OnlyFans have been shown to have negative
impacts such as societal harm, mental health impairments and rising
divorce rates. Nonetheless, top earners can make enormous sums of money
in a short period of time on these platforms, leading to significant
income differentials compared to average workers, including caregivers
who help people reach their physical, psychological and social
potential. (2,3,4,5,6,7,28,29).

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">5.3<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Does drug trafficking offer self-empowerment, emancipation
and financial independence to disadvantaged social groups?

“The cultural scientist and feminist Madita Oeming sees OnlyFans as a
new opportunity for self-empowerment. Women and men on OnlyFans are
independent from studios or producers and have full control over their
content and prices. There is also emancipatory potential in profit.
"Earning that much money yourself can also save you from financial
dependency and toxic relationships" (9).

Porn addiction affects a significant percentage of adults, particularly
young men and women who regularly consume pornography. Taking collective
responsibility is crucial in tackling this societal problem. (35, 36).

Kebab Terror: Who can be held accountable when a person's family
tragically lose their life in xxxistan at the hands of a military power?
Should it be the bomb, the pilot, the plane, the semiconductor maker,
the tool maker for that semiconductor, or even the kebab vendor who fed
the workers at the tool company?

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">6.1<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Is it possible to act morally without having defined
values?

Morality: standards of behavior; principles of right and wrong. (190)

The lack of clear values hampers moral action, enables corruption and
undermines societal morality in psychopathic democracies. (122)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">6.2<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Are the current rules enough to judge the morality of a
trade?

While some people rely on religious leaders for moral guidance, others
follow Kant's Golden Rule, or consequentialist principles, which judge
the ethics of an action based on favorable outcomes. However, religious
and political psychopaths often justify their actions with claims of
positive outcomes, revealing the lack of a universal definition of
morality.

1.  Why do ideological groups like IRGC Quds, ISIS and Al-Qaeda superior
    to modern armies?

Determination and ideological motivation, strong values and flexible
structures define such groups and contrast with the contradictory morals
of hierarchical modern armies.

1.  Are residents of modern societies like Germany a "society"?

Society is the coexistence of people in organized communities with
common laws, traditions and values. Collaboration is vital to human
survival as it allows us to thrive in large groups, work together
effectively and distribute tasks based on individual strengths,
resulting in improved efficiency and productivity. (83)

In modern societies, LGBTQIA2S+ rights are considered non-negotiable,
yet symbolic unity is disregarded, as evidenced by the departure from
the One Love gang. they impose severe sanctions on human rights
violators, but maintain close ties with the most prominent abusers. In
addition, they wage wars under the pretense of promoting democracy,
despite their commitment to world peace. (106, 107,108,153)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">8.1<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>In a war, would humans defend a psychopathic system and
make sacrifices?

Around 30,000 fighters from 85 countries joined ISIS, an organization
with strong religious values. About 10 million Syrians, Iraqis and
individuals from neighboring countries, mostly young Muslim men, fled
the region. Islamic teachings consider flight from jihad (war) to be a
major sin, classified as the twenty-seventh sin. The Prophet of Islam
also expressed his disapproval of Muslims settling among Christians and
Jews. (85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">8.2<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Is a society valid if its members lack common values?

Over a million young Afghans fled Afghanistan after the fall of the
Afghan Republic. Despite spending $145 billion on security forces and
civilian government institutions over 20 years, the US and the West
could not prevent the fall of the Afghan republic once US troops
withdrew. President Ashraf Ghani, who had promised to stay and protect
his people, fled the capital by helicopter to Uzbekistan, contrary to
his earlier promises. (93, 95)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">8.3<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Despite martial law, 8.2 million people fled Ukraine. What
would the numbers be without the ban?

Ukraine was ranked among the most corrupt nations, with The Guardian
calling it “the most corrupt nation in Europe” (97). The level of
corruption in Ukraine is comparable to countries in sub-Saharan Africa
such as Uganda (99). Along with monopoly and lack of transparency, moral
collapse is a major factor contributing to corruption in Ukraine (104).
Despite these challenges, the beauty industry in Ukraine is thriving as
Ukrainians devote a significant portion of their income to cosmetic
products (100). The main industries in Ukraine include banks, cafes,
grocery stores, beauty and clothing stores (101). The Russian army is
made up of contract personnel and volunteers, while Ukrainian male
citizens aged 18–60 face restrictions on leaving the country (102).
Nevertheless, there are over 8 million Ukrainian refugees in Europe.

\#### How does a voting app build the first human society?

People of similar values such as Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, Muslims,
atheists and Westerners can come together and form a group.

1.  What is "Übergesellschaft" aka "Oversociety"?

All societies are part of a larger super-society.

If Society 1, 2, 3, Christian, Hindu, Chinese, Islamic and Atheist
societies all share the common value of banning nuclear weapons, then
all societies must adhere to it.

When society owns and maintains 3 nuclear bombs, the super society must
decide how to react, be it by punishment, isolation or even attack.
American, Western, Muslim, or African values are not prioritized when
making decisions about supersociety.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">9.1<span style="width:4.07pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">  
</span></span>Can international inequality be resolved within
supersociety?

Without corrupt politicians, each individual has the power to take
action against a society that harms others.

• For example, if society 6 introduces a psychopathic economy that leads
to inequality, an aging population, migration, a loss of workforce,
family problems, increased intercontinental flights and growing
polarization, the supersociety must decide how to deal with this
behavior as it is detrimental to everyone involved.

• Society 1: 60% adhere to Islamic values, which include wearing a
headscarf, abstaining from alcohol, avoiding premarital sex and not
having open relationships.

• Society 2: 70% adhere to xxx values, which allow alcohol consumption
and premarital sex, but not open relationships.

• Society 11: 75% adhere to Western values, including freedom of
clothing, food and agency. Societies merge when they share the same
values.

By uniting Buddhist societies in Asia and South America under a common
value system, it becomes possible to create a unified nation.

1.  Cultural inspiration or multicultural fraud?

Comparison is part of human cognition and can promote personal growth
(185). When a society excels, its positive values can inspire and
influence other societies.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">10.1<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>How did cultural inspiration come about in the past?

Cultural influences between Asia and the West were diverse, with notable
contributions such as the mathematical zero and the binary code (226).
Western influences had a significant impact on Eastern culture, shaping
aspects such as food, fashion, lifestyle, and governance (227). Ataturk,
Tsar Peter I, Iranian Reza Shah, and Japan have all experienced varying
degrees of Westernization and modernization (182, 181, 183, 184).

1.  Multiculturalism: a tolerant and open-minded society or polarized
    parallel societies?

• Multiculturalism is often seen as a means of promoting cultural
exchange, tolerance, openness and new ideas. However, studies suggest
that this leads to social tensions, cultural clashes, polarization,
marginalization and language problems.

• bcm (bounded confidence model) describes consensus-like opinion
dynamics in which agents only interact if their opinions are
sufficiently similar. (110, 111)

• The free exchange of information, social media and debates can
contribute to group polarization. (112,113)

• People with similar views tend to follow, share and comment on each
other's posts. Discussing racial attitudes with people who hold similar
attitudes can significantly widen the gap between high and low prejudice
groups. This interaction between extremists can further widen the divide
and contribute to the formation of parallel societies. (114,115,116)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">11.1<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Why does cultural dialogue often lead to tribalism?

• The exchange of ideas and debates can lead to increased polarization.

• The decline in the percentage of people befriending or marrying people
with different political views reflects how social media has contributed
to polarization.

• Strong religious beliefs or the practice of religious customs are not
necessarily indicative of extremism. However, studies suggest that
support for terrorism in Muslim-majority countries is related to mosque
attendance rather than frequency of individual prayers or compliance
with food bans. Similar patterns can be seen among far-right Jewish
extremists in Israel.

• Nationalism and tolerance of autocratic leaders are increasing around
the world, possibly in response to globalization. Research suggests that
when the rich do not interact with the poor or when the poor have
limited contact with the middle class, the well-being of all is
adversely affected. (211,212,213)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">11.2<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Can multiculturalism contribute to international
inequality?

Multiculturalism is essential to the survival of psychopathic economies
and brings tremendous economic benefits.

Germany is the biggest winner. According to Brücker in 2013, without
immigration, the potential labor force in Germany would drop by around
40% by 2050. (117)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">11.3<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Do the countries of origin of the migrants also benefit?

Immigration can lead to a drop in the average IQ in the countries of
origin. Studies have shown that Scotland, for example, has the lowest
average IQ in the UK and compares poorly to most European countries.
(119)

Over 80% of smart students from third world countries migrate to
developed countries, research shows. (121)

A survey conducted by a Job Vision Center found that 77% of third world
workers are willing to migrate. (120)

International organizations estimate that each young migrant of early
working age costs his country of origin US$120,000. (118)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">11.4<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Is multiculturalism a consequence of psychopathic
economics?

Would individuals still seek refuge if the economic differences between
the third world and the industrialized world were eliminated?

Despite its potential for polarization and inequality, psychopathic
economies often benefit from multiculturalism.

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">11.5<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Has the integration of migrants failed?

Sweden: "Integration of migrants has failed" (166)

Integration: the act of unification into an integral whole (167)

Combine: implies some amalgamation or mingling with consequent loss of
identity of each entity (168)

People from poor countries migrate to developed nations where their
high-tech products are more likely to be used, particularly by the US
Army, which often operates in the migrants' countries of origin.
Although migrants resist accepting the values of people from
psychopathic systems that have led to the erosion of their own
population, culture and values, they are already fully integrated into
the psychopathic system as they live and work in a system that
perpetuates inequality (Psychopathegration). (179,180,186)

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">11.6<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Why does business favor psychopathically integrated
populations over organic ones?

Migrants' diminished affinity with their original values increases their
susceptibility to psychopathic integration.

Even psychopathically integrated populations, like sociopaths, have
learned their behavior and are created through life experiences. they
are able to feel emotions, but usually cannot control them. Psychopaths,
on the other hand, are born and suffer from a genetic effect (50,51)

Indian, Pakistani and Asian populations in the UK surprised London by
voting in favor of Brexit, suggesting greater Euroscepticism within
these communities than previously thought. (197)

Iranian migrants have organized protests outside of Iran, demanding
tougher sanctions against their homeland. (221)

1.  Why does democracy always end in nuclear war?

•
<span style="width:28.16pt; color:#000000; display:inline-block"> </span>Although
democracy is considered to be the best political system, it also has
disadvantages: divisive debates, corruption, lack of protection for the
common man, divide-and-conquer tactics, unfair business practices,
craving for power, media abuse and rising inequality. Power dynamics in
social hierarchies affect empathy, with higher-status individuals
showing less accuracy in empathizing with lower-status individuals. (63,
138, 220, 65).

•
<span style="width:28.16pt; color:#000000; display:inline-block"> </span>Psychopathy
is a severe personality disorder characterized by antisocial behavior,
insidiousness, irresponsibility, and a lack of empathy. In order not to
turn democracy into a pathocracy, it is crucial to prevent psychopaths
from gaining power, as there are no limits to their rise to the top.
(64, 68, 79, 80, 172).

•
<span style="width:28.16pt; color:#000000; display:inline-block"> </span>Political
and economic systems provide an ideal environment for psychopaths to
thrive. Approximately 1% of the general population, including 15% of
prisoners, 21% of CEOs and many US Presidents, exhibit psychopathic
traits. Aristotle warned over two millennia ago about the vulnerability
of democracies to fostering psychopaths. In the last fifty years,
psychopaths have gained significant control over every branch of
government. (44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 173, 175)

•
<span style="width:28.16pt; color:#000000; display:inline-block"> </span>Many
successful psychopaths hold leadership positions in large corporations
and in politics, allowing them to take advantage of democratic
organizations. Late bill payments can have serious financial
consequences for individuals, including late payment interest, credit
damage and even imprisonment. On the contrary, companies that often find
ways to avoid taxes have legal departments that deal with lawsuits. (73,
74, 75, 76, 77, 177).

• Instagram sexualizes society.

• Instagram is used by children.

• Early sexual activity leads to unstable relationships and marriages in
adulthood, leading to lower birth rates and an aging population. (10,

</span></span>How do an aging population and labor shortages contribute
to international inequality and exploitation?

Labor and skilled labor shortages in industrialized countries with an
aging population can lead to economic collapse in third-world countries
from which migrants originate. This situation leads to economic
disadvantages, the loss of qualified professionals (especially in the
health sector) and social problems for children who are left behind or
do not grow up in large families. Remittances and money transfers can be
blocked or subject to UN sanctions, while poor countries often have
negative trade balances with developed countries. Negative trade
balances contribute to unemployment and capital outflow. Exploitation,
as defined by Marxist theories, involves the inappropriate use of labor
and resources, particularly the appropriation of another's labor power,
and contributes to greater international inequality
(15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22).

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">13.4<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Why are violent convulsions the only solution to reduce
international inequality?

Studies of the global history of inequality suggest that peaceful means
have never been effective in reducing it. Examples include the use of
violent tactics such as carpet bombing, atomic bombs, slave rebellions
and wars that have reduced social inequality. French colonization in
Haiti ended after the Haitian slave rebellion, which led to the Haitian
massacre. Likewise, the end of slavery in the United States was driven
by slave rebellions and economic factors. The Second World War also
contributed to a significant reduction in income and wealth inequality
in many countries. (23,24,25 26).

<span style="-aw-import:ignore">13.5<span style="width:33.3pt; font:7pt 'Times New Roman'; display:inline-block; -aw-import:spaces">                      
</span></span>Can economic sanctions, brain drain, youth migration and
inequality prompt a country to resort to violent measures?

If everything becomes flat, how can the world and the environment be
exploited on a large scale? Could Iran's uranium enrichment to build
multiple nuclear weapons or North Korea's 100-kiloton nuclear bomb
potentially lead to an end to sanctions and equality? (30,209)

1.  Is the freedom to use a nuclear bomb acceptable?

Over the years, the Iranians have always shown their strong support for
their country's nuclear program. Support was 85% in 2006 and 71% in
2010. A 2013 Gallup poll found that despite sanctions, 84% of Iranians
said they wanted nuclear weapons. A 2013 Zogby poll also found that a
majority (84.5%) opposed ending uranium enrichment and ballistic missile
testing (83.4%). Responsibility for the sanctions varied between

</span></span>Why would leaders in psychopathic regimes never use a
nuclear bomb, but marginalized groups outside the psychopathic power
might?

Experts warn that advances like 3D printing are making it easier for
small groups to covertly create weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile,
those in power now would be less likely to use it. Contrary to
misconceptions, psychopaths are fully aware of the consequences of their
actions; You are not crazy. In 2013, Iran's religious supreme leader
issued an irrevocable fatwa outlawing the development and use of nuclear
weapons under Islamic law. Since then, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a strong
supporter of Iran's nuclear program, has been banned from all Iranian
elections. (154, 162, 163, 164, 178, 195, 216).

1.  Can an election app solve the 2,500-year-old problem of psychopathy
    in democracy?

New smartphones offer advanced verification methods like fingerprint and
face scanning for tasks like online banking, enabling secure
transactions of large amounts of money. (72) Because of the challenge of
identifying psychopaths in a society, non-hierarchical systems could be
put in place. As the saying goes: "He who dines with the devil needs a
long spoon" (69, 70).

</span></span>Can an app replace politicians, MPs, presidents,
governors, and other coveted positions that attract psychopaths?

Presidential responsibilities include drafting treaties, vetoing and
signing bills, representing the nation in foreign negotiations,
enforcing laws, proposing new laws, leading a political party,
entertaining foreign guests, serving the Recognition of foreign
countries and the granting of pardons. Parliamentarians make laws and
oversee the work of the government. (66.67)

Breaking down hierarchies is key to reducing inequality. Can a

1.  Is there a way to have a non-psychopathic economy without turning to
    communism?

Can equal treatment of employees in a company affect quality, work
ethics, effectiveness and efficient use of resources?

Although communism never worked, the most social system in the world
(Germany) has the highest quality of industry and production.

If millionaires were taxed appropriately for all the harm they caused
(environment, inequality, brain drain, forced migration, travel, and
ad-supported consumption), would anyone still be able to own empires

</span></span>Why is it necessary to include an economic sector in the
election app?

Incentivizing individuals with a percentage of losses and wins rather
than fixed salaries increases motivation. For example, each person
receives a base amount of 2% (~€2000) per month, but can earn additional
shares through exceptional performance, requests or online votes.

Non-hierarchical corporations that are more sustainable to the world and
the environment can be favored by society through lower taxes determined
by voting.

The acceptance of selfishness, self-interest and higher earnings
promotes more competition, productivity and sustainability.

1.  How to stop the Islamization of Europe?

Mohammed was the most popular name for boys in Berlin in 2022 (225).
Sweden could have a Muslim population of 31% by 2050, Germany could have
20% and in big cities like Berlin, Düsseldorf or Cologne this could rise
to 60%. It is possible that the concept of Islamic Sharia could become
more important as an expression of Berlin's growing Muslim population.
This growth of Islam is not limited to Europe, as it is currently the
fastest growing religion in India, the US, China and sub-Saharan Africa
(127, 128, 129, 130).

polygyny?

Dating apps are growing in popularity, attracting millions of users.
They allow the top 5% of men to connect with 95% of women, leading to
more sexual activity and an increase in open relationships. This, in
turn, often leads to polygyny, where men show renewed sexual interest as
they meet new women. Unlike women, men are influenced by the Coolidge
effect and seek variety in short-term partners. Research studies and
experiments, including a Tinder-style study, have consistently shown
that men have a higher preference for multiple sexual partners compared
to women. (55,56,62,146,149,151,152)

</span></span>How does polygyny affect men, women and children in
society?

Polygynous societies result in lower status and freedom for women, more
violence and abuse, and poorer mental and physical health. Children in
polygynous families also have more problems and a higher mortality rate.
Polygyny creates an imbalance in the number of unmarried men and women,
leading to intense competition between men for mates and encouraging
men's control over their female family members. Unmarried men are more
likely to commit crime than married men, and polygynous husbands have
more extramarital affairs than monogamous husbands. In addition,
competition for wives is increasing in societies where women and
children are important workers, leading to a larger number of unmarried
men.

There have been 70 generations in the last 2000 years, but 33,000 future

Due to high morale, concern after the Fukushima accident, or heightened

other countries continue to invest in this technology.

The decision to shut down nuclear power plants in Germany has resulted
